# Frequently Asked Questions #

**Q:** Why does my App crash while _Snoop-it_ is attached?

**A:** During the development of _Snoop-it_, we had to deal with loads of idiosyncrasies of the iOS operating system. If your App crashes, you might have spotted another one or you might have hit a bug. Please submit a bug report and let us know about your crash condition.

**Q:** I have enabled the "Bypass Jailbreak Detection" feature of _Snoop-it_, but the Jailbreak is still detected?

**A:** At the moment, only basic jailbreak detection mechanisms are bypassed. Consequently, it might happen that your App wins the cat-and-mouse game. We are planning to significantly improve the jailbreak detection bypass feature within the next months - stay tuned. In the meantime, you might consider using the [xCon](http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/XCon) library complementary to Snoop-it. If you have already figured out how your App performs the jailbreak detection and want us to integrate your bypass into Snoop-it, please submit a bug report.
